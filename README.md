### Project Notes

### Test data
Obtain json file from the following Github project 

https://github.com/leseanbruneau/nodejs-batch-yfin-csv-to-json.git

### ${PRJ_ROOT_DIR}/.env.local File
You need to create a .env.local file to define endpoint for JSON data.  
.env.local only needs to be one line

REACT_APP_FIREBASE_CONFIG.databaseURL='%%ENDPOINT_URL%%'

example:
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_CONFIG.databaseURL='http://localhost:3000'



### ${PRJ_ROOT_DIR}/src/index.js
File contains commented code for the different parts of the demo application

For example, to run first example uncomment the following lines

  import AppDemo1C from './AppDemo1C'
  ReactDOM.render(<AppDemo1C />, document.getElementById('root'));

And then comment out the other AppDemo[2,3,4][C,F].js


### AppDemo1C.js
Simple React Class based components.  
JSON data object is defined in a local variable
Example shows passing props down to child components
   AppDemo1C -> demo1/DropdownListC
   AppDemo1C -> demo1/QuoteDailyListC -> TradingDays

### AppDemo2C.js
Expands first example to moving JSON data object to a server
Second example uses Axios npm package to retreive REST API data
Two endpoints are defined - localhost json-server and Firebase database

Using npm package localhost json-server
1.  Open terminal window 
2.  Change directory to where file all-mrkt-ind.json is located
3.  Run the following to start localhost json-server
    json-server --watch all-mrkt-ind.json --port 3001

Using Firebase database endpoint
1.  Create new Firebase project in Google Firebase console

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
